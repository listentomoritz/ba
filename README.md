# ba
build of a 6 voice polyphonic sythesizer

## goals
1. 6 independent DCOs
1. sawtooth, PWM, variable slope trialgle, sine waveshape, sub pulse
1. noise generator
1. Envelope generator with Hold phase (AHDSR)
1. VCA
1. VCF
2. LFO appliable to DCO, VCF, VCA, PWM
3. separate envelopes for noise and waveforms
4. switch all oscillators to same pitch
5. input signal midi like note on note of control changes
6. differential output
7. chord memory

## timeschedule

### week 1
research individual circuits
digitally controlled triangle oscillator with variable slope??
